# The Plant Guru

_About the app: The full stack app allows a user to get plants that match their lifestyle and needs based on a survey. At currect deployment, the survey does not parse the inputs to match with a database object, however, users can still delight in the joy of a simulation of the process by submitting a quiz which will randomly generate a match for them. All plant data has been sources from a third party API, [trefle](https://trefle.io/)._
